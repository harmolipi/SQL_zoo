### Functionality

This is the [SQL Zoo](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/databases/lessons/sql) project, simply completing the exercises at [sqlzoo.net](https://www.sqlzoo.net).

### Thoughts

Man, this was actually a really great project for learning SQL. It got tedious as it was one, after another, after another, after another, but eventually things finally started to click and some of it felt closer to second nature.

That said, as we got to the last few, the queries really started getting harder to construct and follow, and I don't know that I quite mastered 100% of them. Some I had to look online to get help with, and then I tried my best to follow them and recreate them so I could understand them as much as possible. The last one in `9+_covid_19.sql` in particular befuddled me, because I can't find any differences between the results of my query and the results we're aiming for. If anyone can point out the problem, I'd appreciate it.

Other than that though, most of the other ones made sense eventually. I feel like I know enough to get around SQL now, though I'm ready for a break from the very complex queries. These were good exercises to dive into.

God bless.
